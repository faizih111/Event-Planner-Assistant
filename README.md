# Event-Planner-Assistant

This project is a simple Python program that works as an **Event Planner Assistant**.  
It applies the concepts of **Modules, Dates, Math, JSON, RegEx, and PIP** learned from W3Schools.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Modules**: Uses built-in modules like `datetime`, `math`, `json`, and `re`.
- **Dates**: Calculates how many days are left until an event.
- **Math**: Determines the number of tables needed for guests using `math.ceil()`.
- **JSON**: Stores and retrieves event details in JSON format.
- **RegEx**: Validates the event name to ensure it only contains letters and spaces.
- **PIP**: Notes the ability to install external packages, but this project only uses built-in modules.

## 🖥️ Example Output
Event Name: Birthday Party
Location: Central Park
Date: 2025-12-25
Days left until event: 128 days, 0:00:00

Math Calculation:
Total guests: 53
Seats per table: 10
Tables needed: 6

Event details saved as JSON:
{"name": "Birthday Party", "location": "Central Park", "date": "2025-12-25"}
